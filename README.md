# SkiaSharpHeadlessGpu
SkiaSharpHeadlessGpu is an attempt at headless rendering with SkiaSharp using Vulkan as a GPU backend.

This project is a concept work in progress, to see if headless rendering using Vulkan GPU acceleration can result in performance improvement for rendering multiple images using SkiaSharp.
